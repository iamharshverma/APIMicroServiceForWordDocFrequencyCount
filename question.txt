Create a program that displays how many times an alphabetic word shows up in a file or across files.  The program will be seeded with an input file where each line is another file’s absolute path.  Each file in the absolute path will contain the words that need to tracked. I should be able to run the program and list all the words and their respective counts. The program will need to quickly handle 1000’s lines in the input file and display results in a timely manner. Python is the recommended language but you can use another popular programming language if desired.
 
Requirements for the program:
o    The program must have a CLI or WebUI or API
o    The program/executable has to be standalone.
o    You must provide a set of easy to follow instructions on how to run and execute the program. Assume the system used for running the program has just a base OS installed
o    You must submit
·   all of the source code and the corresponding executable. If you zip all of the contents that will be acceptable or share it via the cloud.
·   unit tests for your application and how to run the tests.
·   Input data used to test your program
 
Moreover
User should be able to select a word (from the list of words) and display which files the word came from, display how many times the word showed up in each file and display how many times the word showed up in total
