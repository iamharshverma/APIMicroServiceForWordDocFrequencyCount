Create a program that displays how many times an alphabetic word shows up in a file or across files.  The program will be seeded with an input file where each line is another file’s absolute path.  Each file in the absolute path will contain the words that need to tracked. I should be able to run the program and list all the words and their respective counts. The program will need to quickly handle 1000’s lines in the input file and display results in a timely manner. Python is the recommended language but you can use another popular programming language if desired.
